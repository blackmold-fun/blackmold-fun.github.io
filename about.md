title: About Me
---

When I started my career in security I worked at a large online university as the security administrator, but that really meant managing “the firewall” which was a 12+ interface Sun box running Checkpoint Firewall. It sucked. At that time, security was in a dark place. It was filled with people who weren’t very happy and who only said no (me included). I eventually got out of the security industry because it just didn’t seem like it was advancing enough, nothing was changing. We were inventing new tech but same old people and processes. To this day, we still seem like we’re a bit in the dark ages of security. Things are breaking all over the place *solar winds cough cough*. Overall, I know we’ve made improvements, but it still doesn’t seem like enough. (Of course, I have no real solutions.)

So that short paragraph gives you an idea of where I am mentally with security, quite down on the whole thing, but I still love the idea of computer security. Every few years I rebuild a new website to focus on security, and quickly abandon it. This is the 3rd or 4th iteration. I’m not even sure. But this is the new one. Maybe it will stick around?

## Blackmold.fun

I called it “blackmold” because I like the idea of something growing into a system without any real initialization, and that the underlying system has no control over what is happening to it. Not so much a virus, but just something that grows on top, something ugly, and hard to get rid of. The vision I have in my head right now is of a black mold taking over a Kuberentes system and running it itself, locking out all the actual users and managing the applications running on it on its own. What would happen if, just like blackmold, security just appeared in your systems and took control? Would it be better, worse, indifferent?
